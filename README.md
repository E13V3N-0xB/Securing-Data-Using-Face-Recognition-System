# Securing-Data-Using-Face-Recognition-System

The project is based on the face recognition and unlocking system. In this project we are going to
capture the picture of the client and then program will unlock the folder using the client photo as
a password. In this project the client has an advantage to secure his/her folder using the face as a
password which will be used to unlock the folder. We will be having multiple modules to
encounter this task. There will be the frontend of the folder unlocking system which have two
option in the starting. The first one is Register in this option the program will save the 100 photo
of the client in the database and map it with his/her name that client will give at the time of
capturing the photo. After pushing the data into the Database our model will be ready to
recognize the particular photo and will tell you the name of the client according to the photo.
Now, After setting up all the data into the database. You will have the option to setup the
password on the folder. At the time of setting up the password on the folder. You will give the
your face as an input and it will generate the database of the your photo accordingly. When you
will try to unlock the folder you need to show your face it will recognize your face using the
machine the algorithm CNN and after validating it with our database it will unlock your folder.
The another thing that we have included in this project is that beside doing locking and
unlocking you can also recognize your face. For that we have another option as well that is
recognize which will try to recognize your picture if your picture exist in the database and it also
be mapped according to your name. So, like Face recognition project it will also tell client
his/her name as well.
